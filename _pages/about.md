Hey there👋, I am Giuliano, a **Computer Science Engineer** and **Ph.D. student** in the [National PhD in Artificial Intelligence](https://www.phd-ai.it/en) here at [Sapienza University of Rome](https://www.uniroma1.it/it/).

I am a member👨‍🔬 of the [SapienzaNLP group](http://sapienzanlp.uniroma1.it/), led by professor [Roberto Navigli](https://www.diag.uniroma1.it/navigli/) and my main research topic is improving *long-document understanding*. In particular I am currently working on document-level *Coreference Resolution* trying to leverage a semantic representation of long texts.

I completed BSc from [Roma Tre University](https://www.uniroma3.it/) and my MSc from [Sapienza University Of Rome](https://www.uniroma1.it/it/), both in Computer Science Engineering🎓.

Before starting the PhD, I worked as a full time NLP Engineer👨‍💻 at [Babelscape](https://babelscape.com/).

I love to play basketball 🏀💕 and I've been a semi-pro for the last 10 years competing for different teams in Rome.
